# Mercator

__Autogeneration of functor and monad instances for Scala types__

Mercator makes it possible to abstract over monads and functors, automatically
constructing contextual instances for types with the requisite methods.

This allows generic implementations of `sequence` and `traverse` to be provided
for all types which define `map` and `flatMap`, provided an appropriate
implementation of `Point` (providing the monadic "unit" operation) can be found.

## Features

- provides an abstraction over functor-like and monad-like types
- generates `Monad`, `Functor` and `Point` typeclasses for type constructors
- constructs a monad typeclass instance for any type with `flatMap`, `map` and a "unit" constructor
- implements `sequence` and `traverse` extension methods for instances of monadic types

## Availability

Mercator has not yet been published as a binary. It is currently waiting for the
final release of Scala 3.3.

## Getting Started

It is not possible to write code such as,
```
def increment[MonadicType[_]](xs: MonadicType[Int]) =
  for(x <- xs) yield x + 1
```
because the compiler is not able to express the constraint that the type
constructor `F[_]` provides the methods `map` and `flatMap` (with the correct
signatures), which are necessary for the for-comprehension to compile.

With _Mercator_, it is possible to demand a contextual instance of `Monad[MonadicType]` to
enforce this constraint. Mercator will automatically instantiate such an
instance at the use-site for any type which has the required methods, like so,
```
import mercator._
def increment[F[_]: Monad](xs: F[Int]) = for(x <- xs) yield x + 1
```

The methods `flatMap` and `map` will be provided to the instance of `F[_]` as
extension methods, which are then used by the for-comprehension.

## Point

An instance of `Monad[F]` will generate an implementation of `point` (sometimes
called "unit", though not to be confused with `Unit`) which
constructs a new instance of the type from a single value. For example, `point(x)` for
`Option` is `Some(x)`, or for `Either` it is `Right(x)`. This implementation
assumes the existence of a unique `apply` method on the type's companion object, and
that applying the value to it will produce a result of the correct type.

A `Point[MonadicType]` instance can always be provided to explicitly specify the
`point` instance for the given type constructor.

## Functors

Mercator also provides a `Functor` typeclass, which provides implementations of just
`point` and `map`. If `map` is required for a particular operation, but `flatMap` is not,
then only the `Functor` typeclass should be summoned.

## Status

Mercator is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Mercator is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 222 lines of code.

## Building

Mercator can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Mercator are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/mercator/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Mercator easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

Mercator was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and training is available from

## Name

TBC

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
