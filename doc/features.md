- provides an abstraction over functor-like and monad-like types
- generates `Monad`, `Functor` and `Point` typeclasses for type constructors
- constructs a monad typeclass instance for any type with `flatMap`, `map` and a "unit" constructor
- implements `sequence` and `traverse` extension methods for instances of monadic types
